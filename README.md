# UT-Auto-Registration-Chrome-Extension
UT Auto Registration Chrome Extension (not allowed by UT registration policy but made for practice)

## Features
- Includes auto-reloading page at registration time
- Add and delete classes from class list
- Finds input fields and classes from class list
- Includes timed auto-search on Amazon to "test" functionality (because UT bans use of scripts for registration)
